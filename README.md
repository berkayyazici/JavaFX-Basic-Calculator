# JavaFX-Basic-Calculator
Right click on the project name (my project name is Calculator) at the top left and click on Export. 
We come to the Java section and click to create a Runnable JAR File. For the Launch configuration part, 
I also created another class called FakeMain so my teacher can start the program. 
For the library handling part, you can select “Extract required libraries into generated JAR” or “Package required libraries into generated JAR” option 
and select any place on your computer as Export destination and export it or you can run it like a console app.
